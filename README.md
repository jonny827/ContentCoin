Content Coin, a NFT Smart Contract Compliance side-chain on the XRP Ledger and its ecosystem provide content: compliance, security, encryption, minting, storage, retrieval, delivery, publishing, privacy, and monetization of tokenized content in the form of Non-Fungible Tokens.  The native token is a deflationary asset and is also used for the payment of digital, visual, audible, physical, and geospatial content. Asset backed tokenomics, and new proofs and staking strategies will maintain a healthy on-chain trustless economy.  The ecosystem empowers content creators through built-for-purpose user friendly tools, and is focused on solving complex real-world problems including eliminating child pornography and content piracy.
