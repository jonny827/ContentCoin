# Content Coin

Content Coin, a NFT Smart Contract Compliance side-chain on the XRP Ledger and its ecosystem provide content: compliance, security, encryption, minting, storage, retrieval, delivery, publishing, privacy, and monetization of tokenized content in the form of Non-Fungible Tokens.  The native token is a deflationary asset and is also used for the payment of digital, visual, audible, physical, and geospatial content. Asset backed tokenomics, and new proofs and staking strategies will maintain a healthy on-chain trustless economy.  The ecosystem empowers content creators through built-for-purpose user friendly tools, and is focused on solving complex real-world problems including eliminating child pornography and content piracy. 


# Technical Roadmap and Estimated Timeline

## Full Ecosystem

An exhaustive roadmap has not been completed to bring every aspect of our ecosystem online but we
believe it will take a minimum of two (2) years to completely buildout our entire pool of resources and
services including the full blockchain.

The ecosystem will evolve through building a proof-of-concept ecosystem leveraging the XRPL directly,
traditional hosting for storage and delivery and then incrementally migrate the decentralized pool of
resources and services to the full Content Coin ecosystem over the estimated two (2) year timeline.

WordPress is a very large and healthy ecosystem that empowers small business owners like creators to
run their own storefronts and therefore would provide an ideal testing ground for validating the use of
the XRPL for NFT’s.

## Current Focus
The plan is to build out the Content Coin - Web Content Service XRPL Integration
and using the Content Service API, create a WordPress plugin ecosystem to empower WordPress users
to create XRPL NFT’s with their Media Library uploads, sell their XRPL NFT’s, store their NFT’s and display
their XRPL NFT’s. We will be bringing on a minimum of 8 developers, 1 to 2 project managers, 1
designer/UX professional, and at least one quality assurance professional to complete the Statement of
Work below.
